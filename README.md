## ⚙️ SOLID Principles Applied

- S: Single Responsibility → Each class manages one responsibility.
- O: Open/Closed → Easy to extend (e.g., add new logger or DB).
- L: Liskov Substitution → Logger implementations respect interface behavior.
- I: Interface Segregation → Logger interface is minimal and focused.
- D: Dependency Inversion → High-level modules depend on abstractions (`ILogger`).
